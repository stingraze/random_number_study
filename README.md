# random_number_study
This is a study of random numbers. 
I have made a Perl script that outputs random numbers (integers), 
lists each number per try, and outputs all the numbers and the occurrence of each numbers.

Enjoy!

I've created a new script (prediction1.py) that hopes to one day learn from random numbers and predict. It it is not able to do so right now, but maybe someday I will find a way! ;-)
